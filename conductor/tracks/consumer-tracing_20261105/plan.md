# Plan: consumers continue the trace (gluon PERF-5.5)

## Phase 1: Consumer spans
- [x] Task: purerestlib/purekafka → 0.12.0 in `build.sbt` f6fb3d7
- [x] Task: Test: a record's `traceparent` becomes the parent of its `<topic> process` span — deviation: no Kafka test harness in this repo; covered by purekafka `KafkaTracingSuite` + order/payment/notification suites + live check
- [x] Task: Wrap each consumer's handling in `KafkaTracing.traced`; thread the tracer from `Main` f6fb3d7
- [x] Task: Full `sbt scalafmtCheck test` (97 tests, green)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1' (Protocol in workflow.md):
      redeploy, consumer spans join producer traces in Tempo
